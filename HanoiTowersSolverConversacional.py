        You are a helpful assistant. Solve this puzzle for me.
        There are three pegs and n disks of different sizes stacked on the first peg. The disks are numbered from 1 (smallest) to n (largest). Disk moves in this puzzle should follow:
        1. Only one disk can be moved at a time.
        2. Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one stack and placing it on top of another stack.
        3. A larger disk may not be placed on top of a smaller disk.

        The goal is to move the entire stack to the third peg.

        Example:
        With 3 disks numbered 1 (smallest), 2, and 3 (largest), the initial state is [[3, 2, 1], [], []], and a solution might be: moves = [[1, 0, 2], [2, 0, 1], [1, 2, 1], [3, 0, 2], [1, 1, 0], [2, 1, 2], [1, 0, 2]]
        This means: Move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 2, then move disk 2 from peg 0 to peg 1, and so on.
        Requirements:
        ‚Ä¢ When exploring potential solutions in your thinking process, always include the corresponding complete list of moves.
        ‚Ä¢ The positions are 0-indexed (the leftmost peg is 0).
        ‚Ä¢ Ensure your final answer includes the complete list of moves in the format: moves = [[disk id, from peg, to peg], ...]

        Since the puzzle is complex when the number of disks N is very large, you will collaborate with another agent to solve it. Every time is your turn to interact, you will receive the following information:
        ‚Ä¢ The current configuration of the problem k, since it may be in the initial state or in an intermediate state.
        ‚Ä¢ The desired number of moves p. This parameter indicates how many moves I want you to make to bring us closer to the solution. This is because when the number of disks N is very large, solving the entire problem becomes very complex. Therefore, I don't want you to provide the complete solution, but rather the next p moves that move us toward the goal.


        Your response should be just a vector of moves, without any additional text or explanations. Example response:
        moves = [[1, 0, 2], [2, 0, 1], [1, 2, 1], [3, 0, 2], [1, 1, 0], [2, 1, 2]]
